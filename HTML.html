    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p><a>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.<img src="html.jpg" width="100%"></p><p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
